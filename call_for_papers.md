## Submission Details 

{: style="text-align: justify"}
Submissions must be written in English, prepared in Springer's LaTeX style LNCS available [here](http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/Authors.html), formatted in PDF and submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pmaiijcai2022).

{: style="text-align: justify"}
PMAI 2022 invites submissions of research, industry and application contributions as well as software demonstrations.

There are two submission formats:
 - _Regular papers_ (up to 12 pages): has at least 10 "standard" pages (1 standard page = 2500 characters) and an appropriate number of references;
 - _Short papers_ (up to 8 pages): results and ideas of interest to the PMAI audience, including position papers, system and application descriptions and presentations of preliminary results.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
Regular papers and short papers must be original, i.e. not published in an earlier workshop or conference or journal.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
All accepted papers are expected to be presented at the conference and at least one author is required to register to the conference.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
The reviewing process is double-blind. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the workshop to present the work. Authors will be required to agree to this requirement at the time of submission.

## Camera Ready Preparation
{: style="text-align: justify"}
The final version of your manuscript must be formatted according to the new _CEUR-ART 1-column style_.

An Overleaf page for LaTeX users is available at [this address](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gwhxnqcghhdt).
Alternatively, you can [download](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip) an offline version with the style files.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
According to CEUR-WS policy, the papers will be published under a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) that will be included in an open-access proceedings volume of [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/), indexed by both Scopus and DBLP.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
When preparing your camera ready paper, please address the comments that the referees kindly provided in order to improve the quality of your contribution.

{: style="text-align: justify"}
For the _"Short paper"_ contributions, please do not forget to explicitly indicate that by inserting the following instruction just after the `\title{}` command:
