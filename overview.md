title: Workshop overview
---

_Process Management_ (PM) is a growing multidisciplinary discipline combining insights from Operation Management, Computer Science, and Data Science (cf., Process Mining). The extraordinary development of AI techniques is paving the way towards a new generation of information systems able to "augment" process management, making them more autonomous, adaptive, intelligent, self-optimizing. These are AI-empowered, trustworthy, and process-aware information systems that continuously reason and act upon data within a set of constraints, with the aim of adapting and improving one or more processes along one or more indicators. To support these sophisticated forms of decision-making, they will need to extract useful insights from the execution logs of ongoing/past process executions, so as to strengthen, integrate, and iteratively revise their domain knowledge.
This poses foundational, conceptual, and technical challenges related to the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI techniques, and how to infuse them within PM. At the same time, delegating autonomy brings pressing requirements on the trustworthiness of such systems, and on their ability to interact with human experts and explain their own behavior.

The first workshop on Process Management in the AI era, aims at bringing together researchers from different research disciplines and a strong interest in promoting the synergy between AI and PM to address the above frontier challenges. We plan a paper submission session, with selected peer-review paper and an invited talk session.
